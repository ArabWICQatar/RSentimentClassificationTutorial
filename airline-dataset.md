### Working with the Airline Tweets Dataset

You will find the Airline Tweets Dataset in our _**GitHub Repository**_. Download it to a suitable folder.

In this part of the tutorial, we will find the bigrams of the data and classify it in R and then find the unigrams and classify it in Weka.



_**The Airline Tweets Dataset contains tweets about various airlines by passengers, about their flight experience. These Tweets are either positive or negative.**_
